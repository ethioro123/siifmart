## Active Features

### Fulfillment Module - Completed By Display
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED (2026-02-05)
- Shows who completed each job and when in all history tabs
- **Files Modified**:
  - `services/supabase.service.ts` - Added field mappings in `wmsJobsService.update`
  - `contexts/DataContext.tsx` - Fixed to use camelCase field names
  - `pages/Fulfillment.tsx` - UI displays completedBy and completedAt
  - `types.ts` - WMSJob interface includes completedBy/completedAt
- **Database**: `wms_jobs.completed_by`, `wms_jobs.completed_at`
- **Root Cause Fixed**: DataContext was passing snake_case fields (`completed_by`) to update function, but service only maps camelCase (`completedBy`)

### WMS Jobs Service
- **Field Mappings** (2026-02-05)
  - Maps snake_case DB fields to camelCase frontend fields
  - Includes: completedBy, completedAt, assignedTo, orderRef, etc.
  - File: `services/supabase.service.ts` (wmsJobsService)

### Sites Service - Allowlist Update Pattern
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED (2026-07-09)
- Rewrote `sitesService.update()` from dangerous `{ ...object }` spread + denylist to explicit allowlist
- **Root Cause Fixed**: camelCase-only fields (`bayCount`, `siteNumber`, `barcodePrefix`) were being sent to Supabase as unrecognized column names → 400 Bad Request
- **Also Fixed**: `zoneCount`, `aisleCount`, `binCount` were silently dropped (deleted but never mapped to snake_case)
- **Files Modified**: `services/sites.service.ts`
- **Pattern**: All service update methods should follow this allowlist pattern (see RULES.md "Service Field Mapping")

### Gamification System - Premium Aesthetic Redesign
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (2026-07-09)
- Redesigned Warehouse and POS gamification settings tabs from cyber-neon to sand/emerald/amber theme
- **Files Modified**: `WarehouseTab.tsx`, `POSTab.tsx`, `POSRoleDistributionList.tsx`, `POSPointRulesList.tsx`
- **Design Tokens**: `#2C5E3B`, `#A9CBA2`, `#EAE5D9`, amber-600/500
