## Active Features

### Fulfillment Module - Completed By Display
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED (2026-02-05)
- Shows who completed each job and when in all history tabs
- **Files Modified**:
  - `services/supabase.service.ts` - Added field mappings in `wmsJobsService.update`
  - `contexts/DataContext.tsx` - Fixed to use camelCase field names
  - `pages/Fulfillment.tsx` - UI displays completedBy and completedAt
  - `types.ts` - WMSJob interface includes completedBy/completedAt
- **Database**: `wms_jobs.completed_by`, `wms_jobs.completed_at`
- **Root Cause Fixed**: DataContext was passing snake_case fields (`completed_by`) to update function, but service only maps camelCase (`completedBy`)

### WMS Jobs Service
- **Field Mappings** (2026-02-05)
  - Maps snake_case DB fields to camelCase frontend fields
  - Includes: completedBy, completedAt, assignedTo, orderRef, etc.
  - File: `services/supabase.service.ts` (wmsJobsService)
