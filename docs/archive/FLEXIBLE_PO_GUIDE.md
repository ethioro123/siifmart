# 🛒 Flexible Purchase Order System - User Guide

## ✅ New Features Overview

The Purchase Order system has been upgraded to be **ultra-flexible**. You can now:
1.  **Enter Vendors Manually**: No need to add them to the system first.
2.  **Select Real Locations**: Choose any warehouse or store as the "Ship To" destination.
3.  **Create Custom Items**: Order products that aren't in your catalog yet.
4.  **Skip Optional Fields**: Only the **Date** and **Items** are required. Everything else (Terms, Tax, Expected Date) is optional.
